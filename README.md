# mandelbrot

A small program that implements the Mandelbrot iterative function. This helps find out whether a complex number is or isn't in the Mandelbrot set.

## Usage

Run main.py.

### Changing the number of iterations

Change `iterate(c)` to `iterate(c, <N>)` on line 48, where `<N>` is the number of iterations.
